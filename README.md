Install Instructions
---

To install, install the zest global and volo:

```
  npm install volo zest-server -g
```

Then simply create from this template into a folder:

```
  volo create folder_name zestjs/zoejs.org
```

Note: On windows, you need to run `npm install`:

```
  cd folder_name
  npm install
```

Finally run the application by executing the 'zest' commandline tool:

```
  cd folder_name
  zest
```

The site runs on `localhost:8082` by default. This can be changed in the zest.cson file.
